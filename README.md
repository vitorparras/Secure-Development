```

Each folder contains relevant resources for enhancing the security of software development practices.

## Guidelines

### Secure Coding Practices
- **secure_coding_practices.md**: A comprehensive guide on secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities and ensure robust application security.

## Tools

### Static Analysis
- **sonarcloud_config.yml**: Configuration file for SonarCloud to perform static code analysis and identify security issues in the codebase.

### Dynamic Analysis
- **zap_config.xml**: Configuration file for OWASP ZAP to perform dynamic application security testing and identify runtime vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Mitigation

### Common Vulnerabilities
- **common_vulnerabilities.md**: A document outlining common software vulnerabilities and recommended practices for mitigating them.

## Security Testing

### Test Plans
- **web_app_test_plan.md**: A detailed test plan for performing security assessments on web applications, including test cases and methodologies.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the relevant folder for the resource you need.
2. Open the `README.md` file in the folder for an overview and usage instructions.
3. Use the provided guidelines and tools to enhance your development practices. For example:

### Secure Coding Practices
Refer to `Guidelines/secure_coding_practices.md` for a detailed guide on secure coding.

### Tools
- **Static Analysis**: Configure and run SonarCloud using `Tools/static_analysis/sonarcloud_config.yml`.
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Use OWASP ZAP with `Tools/dynamic_analysis/zap_config.xml` to test your application.

### Vulnerability Mitigation
Review `Vulnerability-Mitigation/common_vulnerabilities.md` to understand common vulnerabilities and how to address them.

### Security Testing
Use `Security-Testing/test_plans/web_app_test_plan.md` to structure your security testing efforts.
